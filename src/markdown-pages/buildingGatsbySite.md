<p>Not too long ago I had the idea that I wanted to build my own website to write about the projects that I have been working on. I quickly found I had two options, first I could use a website design tool like Squarespace to build and host the website. This would of course be fast, but also quite expensive for just a simple site, especially if you are not planning on doing any e-commerece. The other option you will find is the to design your own website using some JavaScript framework, or pure HTML. This, of course, is much more time consuming but will decreaese the overal cost significantly. I decided since I am a software developer that I should try my hand at building my own website. This post will be for those people like me who had no previous experience with JavaScript but want to build their own simple website.</p>

<p>The framework I have been using is called Gatsby. There are many JavaScript frameworks that can help you build a website, but I wanted something simple, fast, and easy to use. Gatsyb is just that. It is specifically designed for creating static website (i.e. Site whose content does not change depending on the person viewing it), although it is possible to do server side rendering for non-static sites but I will not be covering that in this post. Statis sites are perfect for blogs and other information based sites that do not have to be updated often becuase they are easy to make, do not need a massive server to run on, and are very very fast (one of Gatsbys' big selling points)</p>

<h2>So how does a beginner get started with Gatsby?</h2>
