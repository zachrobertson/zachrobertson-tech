## Introduction to Gatsby

*********************************

Gatsby is the framework I used to build this website, it is advertised as a quick method to build a very fast static website. Gatsby is built with React, a JavaScript library created by Facebook to make user interfaces, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you need to know React to use Gatsby.

As someone who had no JavaScript experience I was worried about the learning curve to build my own website, but with Gatsby it is very simple and the documentation is excellent. For the rest of this article I will walk you through how to create a gatsby site from scratch and some tips and tricks for those people like me with no React or JavaScript experience.

Let's get started!
